## Verify data cable

Verify you have a data cable (not a charging only cable) before proceeding. There's no definitive way to determine the difference in cables if you aren't willing to pull it apart. Trying out a few cables will be the best way to verify.

Once you've located a data cable, check the following to see if you need to install a driver to communicate with your device.

:::tip
If you know you have installed the correct driver, the following step can be used to check if your cable is a data cable.

## Test for driver installation

You can verify that you have a proper data cable (rather than a charge-only type cable) and that the appropriate drivers for your system are installed by performing the following test. Select your operating system below.

If you can see your device, you are ready to flash the firmware. Skip to the [Choose Firmware Flashing Method section](#choose-firmware-flashing-method).

If you do not see your device in the following test, you either:

1. Need to [install a driver](#install-appropriate-drivers).
2. Are currently using a charging only cable.
