Prior to connecting your Meshtastic device to the computer, you should perform the following basic checks.

## Verify data cable

Verify that you have a **data cable** and _not_ a **charging _only_ cable** before proceeding. There is no definitive way to determine the difference in cables if you aren't willing to pull it apart. Trying out a few cables will be the best way to verify.

Once you've located a working data cable, [test for driver installation](/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/#test-for-driver-installation) to see if you need to install a driver to communicate with your device.

If you know you have installed the correct driver, the following step can be used to check if you have a proper data cable.

## Test for driver installation

You can verify that you have a proper data cable (rather than a charge-only type cable) and that the appropriate drivers for your system are installed by performing the following test: 

_select your operating system below_

<Tabs
groupId="operating-system"
defaultValue="linux"
values={[
{label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
{label: 'macOS', value: 'macos'},
{label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

1. Connect your Meshtastic device to your USB port
2. Open a **Terminal** and enter the following command:

  ```shell
  lsusb
  ```
3. You should see something like: 

  ```shell
  ID xxxx:xxxx Silicon Labs CP210x UART Bridge
  # or
  ID xxxx:xxxx QinHeng Electronics USB Single Serial
  # or
  FIXME (WISBLOCK OUTPUT)
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

1. Navigate to `Apple Menu ï£¿ > About This Mac > System Report... > Hardware > USB`. 
2. You should see similar to one of the following entries:
  - `CP210X USB to UART Bridge Controller`
  - `CH9102 USB to UART Bridge Controller`
  - `WisCore RAK4631 Board`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

1. Navigate to `Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)`
2. You should see similar to one of the following entries:
  - `Silicon Labs CP210X USB to UART Bridge (COM5)`
  - `Silicon Labs CH9102 USB to UART Bridge (COM5)`
  - `FIXME (WISBLOCK OUTPUT)`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you can see your device, you are ready to flash the firmware. Skip to the [Flashing Firmware](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/) section.

If you do not see your device after performing the check:

1. You may be using a charging-only cable.
2. You may need to install the USB serial driver corrosponding to your device ([ESP32](/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/installing-esp32-serial-drivers) or [NRF52](/docs/getting-started/serial-drivers/installing-nrf52-serial-drivers)).
