## Recommended Flashing Method for ESP32 Devices

For ESP32 based device users (TBEAM, TLORA, Heltec etc.) 

We recommend using the following methods for flashing ESP32 devices:

1. [Web-based installer](https://flasher.meshtastic.org) - The browser application requires either Chrome or Edge broswers but is an excellent choice for quickly flashing devices.
2. [Python Flasher](/docs/software/python/flasher) - The flasher application does a lot under the hood to prevent you from needing to use the terminal. It also allows you to configure your device.
