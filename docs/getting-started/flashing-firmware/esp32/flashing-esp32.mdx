:::caution
Make sure not to power the radio on without first attaching the antenna! You could damage the radio chip!
:::


For ESP32 devices if the device already has a version of Meshtastic installed using the OTA firmware upgrade tool in the Android app is the friendliest path for users. OTA firmware updates are not yet available on Apple platforms.

If your ESP32 device does not have Meshtastic pre-installed flashing
Before you flash your device start by verifiying connectivity with the device being flashed. Outlined below are steps that can be taken to verify connectivity and, if necessary, to install the appropriate drivers. If you end up needing to install drivers be sure to reboot your computer afterwards to verify the installation is complete.

:::note
The [T-Beam 0.7](/docs/hardware/supported/tbeam#t-beam---v07) board is an earlier version of the T-Beam board, and due to changes in the design in subsequent iterations this board uses a specific firmware file different from the other T-Beam boards.

`firmware-tbeam0.7-1.x.x.bin` is the correct firmware. `firmware-tbeam-1.x.x.bin` is incompatible. For all other [T-Beam](/docs/hardware/supported/tbeam) boards `firmware-tbeam-1.x.x.bin` is the correct selection.

### Install Prerequisite Software

Check if you have `python3` and `pip` installed with the following command

```shell
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If `python3` is not installed, install with

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

If `pip` is not installed, install with

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### Install `esptool`

```shell
pip3 install --upgrade esptool
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

### Install Prerequisite Software

OS X comes with `Python 2.7` installed, but not `pip`. The following uses Homebrew to install `python3` which includes `pip3`. On MacOS you will use `pip3` instead > of `pip`.

:::note
Check if you have Homebrew installed with the following command

```shell
brew -v
```

If it's not installed, follow the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) before continuing.
:::

Check if you have `python3` and `pip` installed with the following command

```shell
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If `python3` is not installed, install with
Install Python3

```shell
brew install python3
```

Confirm `pip3` was installed alongside `python3`

```shell
pip3 -v
```

### Install `esptool`

```shell
pip3 install --upgrade esptool
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org). When installing, make sure to click `Add Python X.Y to PATH`.
- Download and install [Gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org) (or other appropriate shell) and run all subsequent commands from that shell.

:::note
Confirm installation of `python` & `pip` with the following commands.

```shell
py --version
```

```shell
pip --version
```

Connect the radio to your computer using a data USB cable. Confirm your device is talking to your computer using the following command:

```shell title="Command"
esptool chip_id
```

```shell title="Expected Output"

### Navigate to Firmware

`cd` into the directory where you unzipped the latest release. For example:

```shell title="Example"
cd ~/Downloads/firmware/
```

### Install/Update Firmware

Install or Update the device that you have by using the following commands according to your operating system:

:::caution
Be very careful to install the correct load for your board. In particular the popular 'T-BEAM' radio from TTGO is not called 'TTGO-Lora' (that is a different board). So don't install the 'TTGO-Lora' build on a TBEAM, it won't work correctly.

### Select Firmware

Browse to the previously downloaded firmware and select the correct firmware based on the board type and frequency.

:::caution
Be very careful to install the correct load for your board. In particular the popular 'T-BEAM' radio from TTGO is not called 'TTGO-Lora' (that is a different board). So don't install the 'TTGO-Lora' build on a TBEAM, it won't work correctly. If you flash the incorrect firmware: It may appear to flash correctly, but if your device has a screen it might stay blank. On-board radio peripherals might be damaged because of GPIO pin direction, but you should just try to flash with the correct version.
:::

### Flash Firmware

Select `Flash ESP`. It may take a minute or two. Once complete, "Done! Flashing is complete!" will be shown.

## Over the Air Update Instructions

OTA updates are only currently available on Android.
