## Easiest Firmware install options

If you have RAK NRF based devices or a LilyGO T-Echo, [the drag and drop firmware installation process](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/flashing-nrf52) is the easiest solution.

For ESP32 based device users (TBEAM, TLORA, Heltec etc.) we recommend using the [Meshtastic Flasher application](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/meshtastic-flasher). It does a lot under the hood to prevent you from needing to use the terminal. It also allows you to configure your device.

## Manual Firmware Installation

Firmware can be downloaded from the [Downloads](/downloads) page. Your initial installation has to happen over USB from your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.

If you choose to flash the firmware using the manual method, [ESP32 based devices](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/flashing-esp32) and [NRF52 based devices](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/flashing-nrf52) have different methods. Select the appropriate one. If you don't know what chipset your device is, take a look at our supported hardware section.
