## Manual Firmware Installation

Firmware can be downloaded from the [Downloads](/downloads) page. Your initial installation has to happen over USB from your Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.

If you choose to flash the firmware using the manual method, [ESP32 based devices](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/) and [NRF52 based devices](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/) have different methods. Select the appropriate one. If you don't know what chipset your device is, take a look at our [supported hardware](/docs/category/supported-hardware) section.
