:::info
Before flashing confirm that you have [RAK4631](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/) and not a [RAK4631-R](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631-R/) If this is not the case, fear not. The hardware is identical but requires changing the bootloader. Instructions on how to do this are located [here](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/#convert-rak4631-r-to-rak4631).
:::

The NRF52 based devices (LilyGO T-Echo, RAK Wisblock 4631) have the easiest firmware upgrade process. No driver or software install is required on any platform.

Download and unzip the latest frimware from [Meshtastic Downloads](https://meshtastic.org/downloads).

1. Connect your device to your computer with a data USB cable.
2. Double click the reset button on your device (this will put it into bootloader mode) 
3. Notice a new drive will be mounted on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
4. Open this drive and you should see three files: `CURRENT.UF2`, `INDEX.HTM`, and `INFO_UF2.TXT`
5. Drop the appropriate appropriate `firmware-DEVICE_NAME-vx.x.x-xxxxxxx.uf2` file from the release you want to install onto this drive

Once the file has finished copying onto the drive, the device will reboot and install the Meshtastic firmware.
