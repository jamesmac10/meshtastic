## Flashing Methods for nRF52 Devices

The nRF52 based devices have the easiest firmware upgrade process. No driver or software install is required on any platform.

1. The [drag and drop](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop) firmware installation is considered the "manual process" and recommended as the easiest solution.
2. The [Python Flasher](/docs/software/python/flasher) application does a lot under the hood to prevent you from needing to use the terminal. It also allows you to configure your device.
