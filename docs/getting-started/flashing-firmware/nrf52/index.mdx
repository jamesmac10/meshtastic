## Recommended Flashing Method for NRF52 Devices

If you have RAK NRF based devices or a LilyGO T-Echo

1. The [drag and drop](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop) firmware installation process is the easiest solution.

## Convert RAK4631-R to RAK4631

The RAK4631-R is just the same as the RAK4631 in terms of hardware, the only difference is the bootloader it is shipped with.

The RAK4631-R is shipped with the RUI3 bootloader, the RAK4631 with the Arduino bootloader.

Running Meshtastic on RAK WisBlock NRF52-based boards relies on the Arduino bootloader.

The process of converting the bootloader only needs to be performed once.

This conversion requires the use of either a [DAPLink](https://daplink.io/) or [J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/). The most reasonably priced and avaliable is the [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/daplink-tool).

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [pyOCD](https://pyocd.io/)
   ```shell
   pip3 install pyocd
   ```
3. Download the required bootloader: [WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/releases/download/0.4.2/WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex)
4. Connect the RAKDAP as follows:

5. Flash the bootloader
   ```shell
   pyocd flash -t nrf52840 .\WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex
   ```
6. Continue with the normal [flashing instructions](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop)

Alternate methods of flashing are outlined [here](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/bootloader/RAK4630).
