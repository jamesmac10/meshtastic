The only difference between the _RAK4631-R_ (RUI3) and the _RAK4631_ (Arduino) is the bootloader it is shipped with - the hardware is the same.

Meshtastic requires the Arduino bootloader on RAK WisBlock NRF52-based boards. The process of converting the bootloader only needs to be performed once.

This conversion requires the use of either a [DAPLink](https://daplink.io/) or [J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/). The most reasonably priced and available is the [RAKDAP1](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/daplink-tool).

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [pyOCD](https://pyocd.io/)
   ```shell
   pip3 install pyocd
   ```
3. Download the required bootloader: [WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/releases/download/0.4.2/WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex)
4. Connect the RAKDAP as follows:

5. Flash the bootloader
   ```shell
   pyocd flash -t nrf52840 .\WisCore_RAK4631_Board_Bootloader.hex
   ```
6. Continue with the normal [flashing instructions](/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/nrf52/drag-n-drop)

Alternate methods of flashing are outlined [here](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/tree/master/bootloader/RAK4630).
