:::info
Currently only available for ESP32 based devices with external PSRAM. Requires the device to be set as a router.

**Don't enable Store and Forward Plugin on multiple nodes.**
:::

## Overview

:::caution
This is a work in progress and is partially available. Stability is not guaranteed.
:::

The Store Forward Plugin is an implementation of a Store and Forward system to enable resilient messaging in the event that a client device is disconnected from the main network.

Because of the increased network traffic for this overhead, it's not advised to use this if you are duty cycle limited for your airtime usage nor is it advised to use this for SF12 (Long Range / Slow).

:::tip
Once plugin settings are changed, a **reset** is required for them to take effect.

### store_forward_plugin_heartbeat

The Store & Forward Router sends a periodic message onto the network. This allows connected devices to know that a router is in range and listening to received messages. A client like Android, iOS, or Web can (if supported) indicate to the user whether a store and forward router is available.

## Details

### How it works

![Store & Forward - Overview](/img/modules/store_and_forward/store_and_forward-overview.png)

### Requirements

Initial Requirements:

- Must be installed on a router node.
  - This is an artificial limitation, but is in place to enforce best practices.
  - Router nodes are intended to be always online. If this plugin misses any messages, the reliability of the stored messages will be reduced.
- Esp32 Processor based device with external PSRAM. (tbeam v1.0 and tbeamv1.1, and maybe others)

### Usage Overview

- To use / test this you will want at least 3 devices
  - One device will (currently) need be a tbeam v1.0 and tbeamv1.1 configured as a Meshtastic router. Other devices with built in PSRAM will be supported at some point.
  - Two others will be regular clients. Nothing special required.

### Meshtastic channel configuration

Don't use this on the "Long Range / Slow" or "Long Range / Fast" channel settings. You're welcome to try and report back, but those channels have a [very low bitrate](/docs/developers/firmware/radio-settings#pre-defined).

Either use a custom channel configuration with at an at least 1kbit data rate or use "Medium Range / Fast".

Recommended channel setting is for 1.343kbps:

```shell title="Recommended channel setting for S&F plugin"
meshtastic --setchan spread_factor 11 --setchan coding_rate 5 --setchan bandwidth 500
```

With an aftermarket coaxial antenna or moxon antenna, that will give you roughly the same range as "Long Range / Slow" and 5x the bitrate.

### Router setup

:::warning
Don't enable the Store and Forward plugin on multiple nodes!
:::

- Configure your device as a router.
- Name your router node something that makes it easily identifiable, aka "Router".
- Configure the Store and Forward plugin
  ```shell title="Required - Enable the plugin"
  meshtastic --set plugin true
  ```
  ```shell title="Optional - Set maximum number of records to save to device"
  meshtastic --set store_forward_plugin_records 100
  ```
  :::tip
  Best to leave `store_forward_plugin_records` at the default (`0`) where the plugin will use 2/3 of your device's available PSRAM. This is about 11,000 records.
  :::

### Client Usage

Currently, no special configuration is required. To request your history sent to you, send the command into the message field "SF". That's it. This will eventually change to make it easier. At the moment, that message will be sent to everyone on the mesh but we'll (eventually) make it easier to use where there'll be a button (or maybe it'll be transparent) and the command isn't sent as a text message to the mesh.

Available Commands:

| Command |                  Definition                  |
| :-----: | :------------------------------------------: |
|   SF    | Send the last few messages I may have missed |
|   SFm   |  Send a 240 byte payload (Used for testing)  |

The Store and Forward plugin will only service one client at a time. If a second client requests messages while the S&F is busy, the S&F will send a private message to the second client that they will need to wait.
