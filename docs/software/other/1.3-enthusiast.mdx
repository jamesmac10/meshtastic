Meshtastic 1.3 has not been released as a beta.

This page will function as a cheat-sheet to keep our notes on how to work with Meshtastic 1.3.

## Known Limitations

* Meshtastic 1.3 will not work with older versions of Meshtastic. All clients and device nodes on your Meshtastic Network will need to run 1.3.
* OTA updates don't work. We don't have an ETA of when this will be implemented. To update device firmware, you will need to use a cable.
