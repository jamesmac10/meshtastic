The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible and allows easy integration with a number of existing software products and projects.

Current Meshtastic integrations:

- [CalTopo / SARTopo](/docs/software/integrations/integrations-caltopo) - Track Meshtastic nodes in CalTopo and SARTopo.

- [ATAK Plugin](/docs/software/integrations/integrations-atak-plugin) - Official Meshtastic ATAK Plugin for sending CoT to IMeshService in the Meshtastic Android app.

- [Telegram Gateway](https://github.com/tb0hdan/meshtastic-telegram-gateway) - telegram bot that forwards messages to and from a Meshtastic device. 
The purpose of this bot is to act as a bridge between local Meshtastic conference and Telegram chat room. Nicks (Your Name field for Meshtastic) are passed through in both directions.

Support for the integrated products should be sought from their respective authors or vendors.
