The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible and allows easy integration with a number of existing software products and projects.

Current Meshtastic integrations:

- [CalTopo / SARTopo](/docs/software/integrations/integrations-caltopo) - Track Meshtastic nodes in CalTopo and SARTopo.

- [ATAK Plugin](/docs/software/integrations/integrations-atak-plugin) - Official Meshtastic ATAK Plugin for sending CoT to IMeshService in the Meshtastic Android app.

- [MQTT](/docs/software/integrations/mqtt) - Bridging mesh networks over the internet and integrating Meshtastic protocols with popular technologies such as Home Assistant, Node Red, and Adafruit IO.

- [Mesh-Metrics](https://github.com/cordelster/mesh-metrics) - A script that uses meshtastic-cli to pole repeaters for their telemetry and formats for ingestion by prometheus_node_exporter with a Grafana dashbord for visualization and alerting.

Support for the integrated products should be sought from their respective authors or vendors.
