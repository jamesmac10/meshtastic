The minimum Android version is 5.0 (Lollipop 2014, first BLE support), however Android 6 (Marshmallow 2015) is recommended as Bluetooth is more stable.

There is a Play Store [testing program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.geeksville.mesh) with the latest cutting edge changes, though this may come with extra bugs. It is recommended that you follow the [Meshtastic Discourse Alpha Testers](https://meshtastic.discourse.group/c/development/alpha-testers) channel if you decide to join.

The app can also be sideloaded by downloading the .APK from <a href="https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android/releases/latest">GitHub releases</a> page. If you do sideload, you may have to give your browser permissions to run a package installer. If you wish to view the code or contribute to development of the app, please visit the app's <a href="https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android">GitHub page</a>.
