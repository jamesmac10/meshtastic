The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible, and a number of community projects have been made to fit different people's needs. If you wish to create your own application or module, please read the information in the developers section, and tell us about your project on the forum.

Current community projects:

- [Meshtastic module for ATAK](/docs/software/community/community-atak) (Android Team Awareness Kit)
- [PyGUI](/docs/software/community/community-pygui) - Platform independent graphical user interface for Meshtastic devices
- [Go CLI](/docs/software/community/community-go) - A command line interface using Go that requires no pre-requisites to be installed

Support for these projects should be sought from their respective authors.
