:::info

The ATAK Forwarder plugin has recently been updated to support Meshtastic 2.0.6+ but is currently a pre-release version to allow for additional testing to be completed.

- After installing you need to open the Meshtastic app and click the add device "+" so it will ask for Bluetooth permissions.

:::

The ATAK Forwarder plugin requires the Meshtastic Android app to be installed.

This is a plugin for ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit) that uses Meshtastic to provide off-grid communications. This includes plotting the position of others on the map, transmission of markers and routes, and chat messages.
