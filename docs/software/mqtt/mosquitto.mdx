### Using mosquitto on a mac

1. install mqtt server

   ```sh
   brew install mosquitto
   ```

2. start the mqtt server

   ```sh
   brew services restart mosquitto
   ```

3. Do a quick test of server, start a subscriber on a topic:

   Note: this will wait until you press control-c (publish a message, see below)

   ```sh
   mosquitto_sub -t test/hello
   ```

4. In another window, publish a message to that topic:

   ```sh
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -q 0 -t test/hello -m 'yo!'
   ```

5. For Meshtastic to be able to access that server, two settings need to be changed in the
   `/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` file:

   ```shell
   listener 1883 0.0.0.0
   allow_anonymous true
   ```

6. Restart the service:

   ```shell
   brew services restart mosquitto
   ```

7. If you are using the mac firewall, you will need to go into: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Firewall Options and add it.
