## Overview

Meshtastic Channels: Can create a _somewhat_ secure method of communication on the same mesh network. The channel can be encrypted to prevent normal people from listening in on the traffic. But, it could probably be easily [cracked](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/46559/what-are-the-chances-that-aes-256-encryption-is-cracked) by determined individuals. See [Channel Config](/docs/settings/channel) for more info. It is also possible that your location could be triangulated by determined individuals.
