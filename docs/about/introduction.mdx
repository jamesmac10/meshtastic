MeshtasticÂ® is a project that enables you to use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communication platform in areas without existing or reliable communications infrastructure. This project is 100% community driven and open source!

### Features

- Long range ([_206km record by StarWatcher, CVR, rook, kboxlabs_](/docs/overview/range-tests#current-record))
- No phone required for mesh communication
- Decentralised communication - no dedicated router required
- Encrypted communication
- Excellent battery life
- Send and receive text messages between members of the mesh
- Optional GPS based location features
- And more!

## How it works

The underlying technology, LoRa, is a long range radio protocol available to most regions without requiring additional licensing or certification, like HAM operators.

The radios automatically rebroadcast messages they receive in order to create a mesh network so that everyone in the group can receive messages - even from the furthest member. Depending on settings used, the Meshtastic mesh can sustain up to 80 device nodes.

Meshtastic radios can be paired to a single phone so that your friends and family are able to address a message to your specific radio. Each device supports a connection from a single user at a time.
