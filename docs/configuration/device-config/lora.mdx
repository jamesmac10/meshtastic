The LoRa config options are: Region, Modem Preset, Max Hops, Transmit Power, Bandwidth, Spread Factor, Coding Rate, Frequency Offset, Transmit Enabled, Channel Number and Ignore Incoming Array.  LoRa config uses an admin message sending a `Config.LoRa` protobuf.

## LoRa Config Values

:::note
You must set your device's `lora.region` setting. This will ensure that you are operating within the legal limits for your area.
:::

### Region
Sets the region for your node. Default is `unset`. As long as this is not set, the node screen will display a message and not transmit any packets.

<LoRaRegions />

### Modem Preset
Use a sensible default for the modem. Default is `unset` which equates to `LONG_FAST`. Also 'Use Presets' has to be defined, which is the default. If 'Use Presets' is not defined, the modem will be configured manually with Bandwidth, Spread Factor, and Coding Rate.

### Max Hops
Maximum number of hops. This can't be greater than 7. Default is 3 which should be fine for most applications. _**Really, 3 is fine.**_

### Transmit Power

If zero then, use default max legal continuous power (i.e. something that won't burn out the radio hardware)

In most cases you should use zero here. Units are in dBm.

### Bandwidth

Bandwidth in MHz

Certain bandwidth numbers are 'special' and will be converted by the device firmware to the appropriate floating point value: 31 -> 31.25MHz

### Spread Factor

A number from 7 to 12. Indicates the number of chirps per symbol as 1<<spread_factor.

### Coding Rate

The denominator of the coding rate. ie for 4/5, the value is 5. 4/8 the value is 8.

### Frequency Offset

This parameter is for advanced users with advanced test equipment, we do not recommend most users use it.

A frequency offset that is added to to the calculated band center frequency. Used to correct for crystal calibration errors.

### Transmit Enabled

Allows you to enable and disable transmit (TX) from the LoRa radio. Useful for hot-swapping antennas and other tests.

Defaults to true

### Channel Number
This is controlling the actual hardware frequency the radio is transmitting on. A channel number between 1 and NUM_CHANNELS (whatever the max is in the current region). If this is ZERO/UNSET then the rule is "use the old channel name hash based algorithm to derive the channel number".

### Ignore Incoming Array

For testing it is useful sometimes to force a node to never listen to particular other nodes (simulating radio out of range). All nodenums listed in the ignore_incoming array will have packets they send dropped on receive (by router.cpp)

### Override Duty Cycle Limit

Setting this option to 'true' means the device will ignore the hourly duty cycle limit in Europe. This means that you might violate regulations if the device transmits too much. By default, this option is set to 'false,' which means the device will stop sending data when it reaches the hourly limit and will start again when it is allowed to do so.

:::info

LoRa Config options such as Region, Modem Preset, and Hop Limit can be configured on Android.

1. Open the Meshtastic App
2. Navigate to: **Vertical Ellipsis (3 dots top right) > Device Settings > LoRa Config**

Configuration of Region, Modem Preset and Hop Limit is available on iOS, iPadOS and macOS at Settings > Radio Configuration > LoRa.

:::info

LoRa config commands are available in the python CLI. Example commands are below:

:::

|   Setting    |                               Acceptable Values                               |      Default      |
| :----------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------: |
| lora.modem_preset |   `LONG_FAST`, `LONG_SLOW`, `VERY_LONG_SLOW`, `MEDIUM_SLOW`, `MEDIUM_FAST`, `SHORT_SLOW`, `SHORT_FAST`       | `LONG_FAST` |
|    lora.region    |     `UNSET`, `US`, `EU_433`, `EU_868`, `CN`, `JP`, `ANZ`, `KR`, `TW`, `RU` ,`IN`, `NZ_865`, `TH`, `LORA_24` |      `UNSET`      |
| lora.hop_limit    |     `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`   |   `3` |
| lora.override_duty_cycle    |     `false`, `true`    |   `false` |

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.


```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set lora.region US --set lora.modem_preset LONG_FAST
