The device config options are: Role, Serial Output, and Debug Log. Device config uses an admin message sending a `Config.Device` protobuf.

## Device Config Values

### Roles
| Device Role    | Description                                                                                                               | Best Uses                                                                                                                              |

| CLIENT_HIDDEN  | Device that only broadcasts as needed for stealth or power savings.                                                       | Use in stealth/hidden deployments or to reduce airtime/power consumption while still participating in the network.                     |
| TRACKER        | Broadcasts GPS position packets as priority.                                                                              | Tracking the location of individuals or assets, especially in scenarios where timely and efficient location updates are critical.      |
| LOST_AND_FOUND | Broadcasts location as message to default channel regularly for to assist with device recovery.                           | Used for recovery efforts of a lost device.                                                                                            |
| SENSOR         | Broadcasts telemetry packets as priority.                                                                                 | Deploying in scenarios where gathering environmental or other sensor data is crucial, with efficient power usage and frequent updates. |
| TAK            | Optimized for ATAK system communication, reduces routine broadcasts.                                                      | Integration with ATAK systems (via the Mesthastic ATAK Plugin) for communication in tactical or coordinated operations.                |

### Rebroadcast Mode

This setting defines the device's behavior for how messages are rebroadcasted.

|        Value        |                                                                                      Description                                                                                       |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|        `ALL`        |   ALL (Default) - This setting will rebroadcast ALL messages from its primary mesh as well as other meshes with the same modem settings, including when encryption settings differ.    |
| `ALL_SKIP_DECODING` |                      ALL_SKIP_DECODING - Same as behavior as ALL, but skips packet decoding and simply rebroadcasts them. **Only available with Repeater role.**                       |
|    `LOCAL_ONLY`     | LOCAL_ONLY - Ignores observed messages from foreign meshes that are open or those which it cannot decrypt. Only rebroadcasts message on the nodes local primary / secondary channels.  |
|    `KNOWN_ONLY`     | KNOWN_ONLY - Ignores observed messages from foreign meshes like LOCAL_ONLY, but takes it a step further by also ignoring messages from nodenums not in the node's known list (NodeDB). |

### Serial Console

Acceptable values: `true` or `false`

Disabling this will disable the SerialConsole by not initializing the StreamAPI.

:::info

Devices utilizing "sleep" to save power will have unreliable serial output, as it is disabled when the device enters sleep. For ROUTER role, consider switching to ROUTER_CLIENT.

:::

### Debug Log

Acceptable values: `true` or `false`

By default we turn off logging as soon as an API client connects. Set this to true to leave the debug log outputting even when API is active.

### GPIO for user button

This is the GPIO pin number that will be used for the user button, if your device does not come with a predefined user button.

### GPIO for PWM Buzzer

This is the GPIO pin number that will be used for the PWM buzzer, if your device does not come with a predefined buzzer.

### Node Info Broadcast Seconds

This is the number of seconds between NodeInfo message broadcasts from the device. The device will still respond ad-hoc to NodeInfo messages when a response is wanted.

### Double Tap as Button Press

This option will enable a double tap, when a supported accelerometer is attached to the device, to be treated as a button press.

### Managed Mode

Enabling Managed mode will restrict access to all radio configurations via client applications. Radio configurations will only be accessible through the Admin channel. To avoid being locked out, make sure the Admin channel is working properly before enabling it.

:::tip

Because the device will reboot after each command is sent via CLI, it is recommended when setting multiple values in a config section that commands be chained together as one.

```shell title="Example:"
meshtastic --set device.role CLIENT --set device.debug_log_enabled true
```

:::

```shell title="Set the role to client"
meshtastic --set device.role CLIENT
```

```shell title="Disable serial console"
meshtastic --set device.serial_enabled false
```

```shell title="Enable debug logging"
meshtastic --set device.debug_log_enabled true
```
