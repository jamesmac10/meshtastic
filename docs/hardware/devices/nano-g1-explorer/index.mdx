The Nano G1 Explorer, powered by Meshtastic, is a significant upgrade from the Nano G1. It incorporates the latest RF technologies from B&Q Consulting, featuring a new internal wide-band LoRa antenna that can support frequencies ranging from 815 MHz to 940 MHz. With this new antenna, combined with an optimized wide-band LoRa RF frontend circuit, the Nano G1 Explorer is capable of working with the majority of LoRa frequency bands worldwide without the need for antenna changes. The device's design also takes into account the potential impact of the human body on its antenna performance, ensuring optimal RF performance even when carried in a pocket.

### Features

- Meshtastic pre-installed.
- New internal GPS antenna that significantly reduces GPS lock time compared to the Nano G1. Additionally, the GPS module can be set to a low-power mode with the GPS physical switch.
- Integrated enhanced message notification circuit for LED or Buzzer, configurable via physical switches.
- Physical power switch to easily turn the device on/off.
- Replaceable 1.3" OLED screen with a FPC connector.
- Internal Li-Polymer Battery Charger. _(An optional 3.7V 603450 JST 1.25mm Rechargeable Li-Polymer Battery can also be installed.)_
- Buck-boost converter to provide stable 3.3V to the system even in the event the Li-Polymer battery voltage drops to as low as 2.5V. Supply voltage stability is very important to ensure that the performance of RF circuits meets design expectations.
