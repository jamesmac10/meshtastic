## GPS Module

### Introduction
In this guide, we'll explore how to significantly upgrade your Heltec ESP32 V3 board by integrating the GT-U7 GPS Module. This addition not only equips your device with precise GPS capabilities but also embeds a real-time clock (RTC), eliminating the need for WiFi or a smartphone to track time. This is particularly beneficial for mesh networks, where knowing the duration since the last seen device is crucial.

However, it's important to note that the GPS module increases the power demand of your node. We'll address this by detailing how to incorporate a switch or an NPN 2N2222 transistor into your setup. This enables firmware-controlled power management, conserving battery life without sacrificing functionality.

### Benefits
- **GPS Capabilities**: Enhance your node with the ability to determine its location with high precision. This is invaluable for tracking, mapping, and numerous other applications where location data is critical.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: Maintain accurate timekeeping on your mesh network without external time sources like the internet or a connected smartphone.

### Considering Power Consumption
The GT-U7 module is power-hungry, potentially shortening the battery lifespan of your node. To mitigate this, we recommend two approaches:
 - **Manual Switch**: A simple on/off switch for the GPS module, allowing for manual power management.
 - **NPN 2N2222 Transistor**: Offers automatic power control through the firmware. For example, programming the device to turn off the GPS module after a set period or upon specific conditions, like pressing the user button three times.

### Materials Needed
 - Heltec ESP32 V3 board
 - GT-U7 GPS Module
 - NPN 2N2222 Transistor
 - Wires and soldering equipment
 - (Optional) Switch for manual power control

### Instructions

 1. Solder a cable from the TXD slot on the GPS module to GPIO 48 on Heltec board. (You may choose your own GPIO pin)
 2. Solder a cable from the RXD slot on the GPS module to GPIO 47 on Heltec board. (You may choose your own GPIO pin)
 3. Solder a cable from the GND slot on the GPS module to GND pin on Heltec board.
 4. Solder a cable from left leg of NPN 2N2222 Transistor to VCC skit on GPS module.
 5. Solder a cable from Right leg of NPN 2N2222 Transistor to 3V/5V pin on Heltec board.
 6. Solder a cable from Middle leg of NPN 2N2222 Transistor to GPIO 48 of Heltec board. (You may choose your own GPIO pin)
 7. Go to Meshtastic app > Radio Configurations > Position
 8. Set GPS_RX_PIN to 48 (This will communicate to the TXD slot on the GPS)
 9. Set GPS_TX_PIN to 47 (This will communicate to the RXD slot on the GPS)
 10. Set PIN_GPS_EN to 46 (This will allow the meshtastic firmware to turn off the power on the GPS board with the user button of the Heltec Board by pressing it 3 times)

## Troubleshooting Tips

If the GPS module does not power on, check the connections to the transistor and ensure that the middle pin is properly configured on the firmware's settings.
If "GPS is Dissable" message, press the user button on the Heltec 3 times to enable.
If "No GPS Present" message, Check the TXD and RXD are configure correctly
If "No GPS Lock" message, walk around or move node to another location with access to the sky for a bit to lock on properly.
If the location is not accurate, walk around to properly lock on.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you'll enhance your Heltec ESP32 V3 board with valuable GPS capabilities and an RTC, all while managing power consumption effectively. Whether for a hobby project or a more serious application, these additions will significantly expand the potential of your device. Happy Meshing
