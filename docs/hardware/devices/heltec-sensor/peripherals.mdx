## Capsule Sensor V3

### Introduction
Strong extensibility is an important feature of Capsule Sensor V3. By replacing the sensor module at the bottom of the device, the device can be flexibly used in various occasions.

:::warning
Different sensors may require different firmware versions, and the current version is based on the GNSS version. We will update the other firmware as soon as possible.
