The RAK WisBlock is a low power modular hardware system that can be used to build Meshtastic devices. Soldering is only required for the optional OLED screen.

RAK Wireless currently sell a [Meshtastic Starter kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit) that has the minimum you need to get started. If you wish to purchase parts separately, you will need a [base board](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base), a [core 4631 LPWAN module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core/products/rak4631-lpwan-node), and optionally a GPS Sensor, screen or other module to build a Meshtastic device. Please ensure you choose the correct operating frequency for your country when purchasing.

Please see the RAK documentation for the correct way to connect your hardware to ensure that you do not damage the device. There is currently no pin required to pair RAK devices via BLE.

Flashing the firmware is a simple process. Connect your device to your computer via USB, click the reset button twice, and a drive will appear. On Windows, Linux, or Mac, drag the appropriate .uf2 firmware file onto the root of the drive and the device will restart and the firmware will be updated. Or, you can use [Meshtastic-flasher](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-gui-installer). RAK have also provided [Installation instructions](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Quickstart/#rak4631-lora-mesh-via-meshtastic) for Meshtastic.


## Core Module

There are two core modules supported by Meshtastic:

<Tabs
groupId="rakcore"
defaultValue="RAK4631"
values={[
{label: 'RAK4631', value: 'RAK4631'},
{label: 'RAK11200', value: 'RAK11200'}
]}>
<TabItem value="RAK4631">

The main supported code is the [WisBlock LPWAN Module RAK4631](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4631-lpwan-node).  
(Please note this is different to the RAK4631-R which uses different firmware incompatible with Meshtastic).

- nRF52840 microprocessor - Bluetooth BLE 5.0 and very low power consumption
- SX1262 - LoRa transceiver
- Frequency options:
  - 433 MHz
  - 470 MHz
  - 799 MHz
  - 865 MHz
  - 868 MHz
  - 915 MHz
  - 920 MHz
  - 923 MHz
- U.FL antenna connector

Further information on the RAK4631 can be found on the [RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK4631/Overview/#product-description).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RAK11200">

The [RAK11200](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wiscore-esp32-module-rak11200) is currently only supported on the RAK5005-O base board. This provides the benefits of WiFi, but sacrifices the very low power consumption of the nRF microprocessor used on the RAK4631.

- ESP32-WROVER microprocessor - Bluetooth 4.2 & WiFi 802.11 b/g/n

Further information on the RAK11200 can be found on the [RAK Documentation Center](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK11200/Overview/#product-description).

The RAK11200 does not contain a LoRa transceiver, and this needs to be added separately in the form of the [RAK13300 LPWAN module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak13300-wisblock-lpwan). This occupies the IO Port of the base board.

The RAK13300 has the following specifications:
- SX1262 - LoRa transceiver
- Frequency options:
  - 433 MHz
  - 470 MHz
  - 864 MHz
  - 865 MHz
  - 868 MHz
  - 915 MHz
  - 920 MHz
  - 923 MHz
- U.FL antenna connector

<TabItem value="E-Ink">

The [RAK1400 EPD module](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-epd-module-rak14000) is an ultra low power E-Ink display with three user buttons.

- 2.13 inch black and white E-Ink display
- Three button module
- Resolution 212 x 104 pixels
- Occupies the IO Port of a Wisblock Base
