The RAK WisBlock is a low power modular hardware system that can be used to build Meshtastic devices. Soldering is only required for the optional OLED screen.

As of February 6, 2022, there is a [Meshtastic Getting Started kit](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit) that has the minimum you need to get started.

You will need a [base board](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base), a [core 4631 LPWAN module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-core/products/rak4631-lpwan-node), and optionally a GPS Sensor to build a Meshtastic device.

Both available base boards ([5005](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/products/rak5005-o-base-board) & [19003](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-base/products/wisblock-base-board-rak19003)) have a reset button, support an OLED screen, and have built in connectors for a 3.7V LIPO battery (max 4.3V) and 5V Solar panel (max 5.5V)

A user button is not possible with the 19003 base board. It may be possible to add a user button to the 5005 base board using the [13002 IO module](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-interface/products/adapter-module-rak13002).

To add a GPS to the 5005 base board, you need the [1910 GPS sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/collections/wisblock-sensor/products/rak1910-max-7q-gnss-location-sensor). It is supported on slot A of the 5005 board via UART.

To add a GPS to the 19003 base board, you need the [12500 GPS sensor](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisblock-gnss-location-module-rak12500). It is supported via I2C on slot B for firmware versions 1.49 and above.

Flashing the firmware is a simple process. Connect your device via USB, click the reset button twice, and a drive will appear. On Windows, Linux, or Mac, drag the appropriate .uf2 firmware file onto the root of the drive and the firmware will be updated. Or, you can use [Meshtastic-flasher](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-gui-installer)

There is currently no pin required to pair RAK devices via BLE.

There is development activity to get sensors added in Meshtastic core. For example, the Environment Sensor.
