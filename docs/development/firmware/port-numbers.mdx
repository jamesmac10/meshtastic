Any new app that runs on the device or via sister apps on phones/PCs should pick and use a unique "portnum" for their applications use.

The current list of port numbers can be found listed in the [protobufs](https://buf.build/meshtastic/protobufs/docs/main:meshtastic#meshtastic.PortNum)

## Assignment

PortNums should be assigned by the following ranges:

| Portnum | Usage                                                                                                                  |
| :-----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
