### Channel

:::note `message` description
A pair of a channel number, mode and the (sharable) settings for that channel
:::



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| index | int32 | The index of this channel in the channel table (from 0 to MAX_NUM_CHANNELS-1) (Someday - not currently implemented) An index of -1 could be used to mean "set by name", in which case the target node will find and set the channel by settings.name. |
| settings | [`ChannelSettings`](#channelsettings) | The new settings, or NULL to disable that channel |
| role | [`Channel.Role`](#channelrole) | TODO: REPLACE |




### ChannelSettings

:::note `message` description
Full settings (center freq, spread factor, pre-shared secret key etc...)
needed to configure a radio for speaking on a particular channel This
information can be encoded as a QRcode/url so that other users can configure
their radio to join the same channel.
A note about how channel names are shown to users: channelname-Xy
poundsymbol is a prefix used to indicate this is a channel name (idea from @professr).
Where X is a letter from A-Z (base 26) representing a hash of the PSK for this
channel - so that if the user changes anything about the channel (which does
force a new PSK) this letter will also change. Thus preventing user confusion if
two friends try to type in a channel name of "BobsChan" and then can't talk
because their PSKs will be different.
The PSK is hashed into this letter by "0x41 + [xor all bytes of the psk ] modulo 26"
This also allows the option of someday if people have the PSK off (zero), the
users COULD type in a channel name and be able to talk.
Y is a lower case letter from a-z that represents the channel 'speed' settings
(for some future definition of speed)
FIXME: Add description of multi-channel support and how primary vs secondary channels are used.
FIXME: explain how apps use channels for security.
explain how remote settings and remote gpio are managed as an example
:::



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| channel_num | uint32 | Deprecated in favor of LoraConfig.channel_num |
| psk | bytes | A simple pre-shared key for now for crypto. Must be either 0 bytes (no crypto), 16 bytes (AES128), or 32 bytes (AES256). A special shorthand is used for 1 byte long psks. These psks should be treated as only minimally secure, because they are listed in this source code. Those bytes are mapped using the following scheme: `0` = No crypto `1` = The special "default" channel key: {0xd4, 0xf1, 0xbb, 0x3a, 0x20, 0x29, 0x07, 0x59, 0xf0, 0xbc, 0xff, 0xab, 0xcf, 0x4e, 0x69, 0xbf} `2` through 10 = The default channel key, except with 1 through 9 added to the last byte. Shown to user as simple1 through 10 |
| name | string | A SHORT name that will be packed into the URL. Less than 12 bytes. Something for end users to call the channel If this is the empty string it is assumed that this channel is the special (minimally secure) "Default"channel. In user interfaces it should be rendered as a local language translation of "X". For channel_num hashing empty string will be treated as "X". Where "X" is selected based on the English words listed above for ModemPreset |
| id | fixed32 | Used to construct a globally unique channel ID. The full globally unique ID will be: "name.id" where ID is shown as base36. Assuming that the number of meshtastic users is below 20K (true for a long time) the chance of this 64 bit random number colliding with anyone else is super low. And the penalty for collision is low as well, it just means that anyone trying to decrypt channel messages might need to try multiple candidate channels. Any time a non wire compatible change is made to a channel, this field should be regenerated. There are a small number of 'special' globally known (and fairly) insecure standard channels. Those channels do not have a numeric id included in the settings, but instead it is pulled from a table of well known IDs. (see Well Known Channels FIXME) |
| uplink_enabled | bool | If true, messages on the mesh will be sent to the *public* internet by any gateway ndoe |
| downlink_enabled | bool | If true, messages seen on the internet will be forwarded to the local mesh. |








### Channel.Role

:::note `enum` description
How this channel is being used (or not).
Note: this field is an enum to give us options for the future.
In particular, someday we might make a 'SCANNING' option.
SCANNING channels could have different frequencies and the radio would
occasionally check that freq to see if anything is being transmitted.
For devices that have multiple physical radios attached, we could keep multiple PRIMARY/SCANNING channels active at once to allow
cross band routing as needed.
If a device has only a single radio (the common case) only one channel can be PRIMARY at a time
(but any number of SECONDARY channels can't be sent received on that common frequency)
:::


| Name | Number | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `DISABLED` | `0` | This channel is not in use right now |
| `PRIMARY` | `1` | This channel is used to set the frequency for the radio - all other enabled channels must be SECONDARY |
| `SECONDARY` | `2` | Secondary channels are only used for encryption/decryption/authentication purposes. Their radio settings (freq etc) are ignored, only psk is used. |

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| use_preset | bool | When enabled, the `modem_preset` fields will be adheared to, else the `bandwidth`/`spread_factor`/`coding_rate` will be taked from their respective manually defined fields |
| modem_preset | [`Config.LoRaConfig.ModemPreset`](#configloraconfigmodempreset) | Either modem_config or bandwidth/spreading/coding will be specified - NOT BOTH. As a heuristic: If bandwidth is specified, do not use modem_config. Because protobufs take ZERO space when the value is zero this works out nicely. This value is replaced by bandwidth/spread_factor/coding_rate. If you'd like to experiment with other options add them to MeshRadio.cpp in the device code. |
| bandwidth | uint32 | Bandwidth in MHz Certain bandwidth numbers are 'special' and will be converted to the appropriate floating point value: 31 -> 31.25MHz |
| spread_factor | uint32 | A number from 7 to 12. Indicates number of chirps per symbol as 1<<spread_factor. |
| coding_rate | uint32 | The denominator of the coding rate. ie for 4/5, the value is 5. 4/8 the value is 8. |
| frequency_offset | float | This parameter is for advanced users with advanced test equipment, we do not recommend most users use it. A frequency offset that is added to to the calculated band center frequency. Used to correct for crystal calibration errors. |
| region | [`Config.LoRaConfig.RegionCode`](#configloraconfigregioncode) | The region code for the radio (US, CN, EU433, etc...) |
| hop_limit | uint32 | Maximum number of hops. This can't be greater than 7. Default of 3 |
| tx_enabled | bool | Disable TX from the LoRa radio. Useful for hot-swapping antennas and other tests. Defaults to false |
| tx_power | int32 | If zero then, use default max legal continuous power (ie. something that won't burn out the radio hardware) In most cases you should use zero here. Units are in dBm. |
| channel_num | uint32 | This is controlling the actual hardware frequency the radio is transmitting on. Most users should never need to be exposed to this field/concept. A channel number between 1 and NUM_CHANNELS (whatever the max is in the current region). If ZERO then the rule is "use the old channel name hash based algorithm to derive the channel number") If using the hash algorithm the channel number will be: hash(channel_name) % NUM_CHANNELS (Where num channels depends on the regulatory region). |
| ignore_incoming | uint32 | For testing it is useful sometimes to force a node to never listen to particular other nodes (simulating radio out of range). All nodenums listed in ignore_incoming will have packets they send droped on receive (by router.cpp) |

| fixed_position | bool | If set, this node is at a fixed position. We will generate GPS position updates at the regular interval, but use whatever the last lat/lon/alt we have for the node. The lat/lon/alt can be set by an internal GPS or with the help of the app. |
| gps_enabled | bool | Is GPS enabled for this node? |
| gps_update_interval | uint32 | How often should we try to get GPS position (in seconds) or zero for the default of once every 30 seconds or a very large value (maxint) to update only once at boot. |

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| from | fixed32 | The sending node number. Note: Our crypto implementation uses this field as well. See [crypto](/docs/developers/firmware/encryption) for details. FIXME - really should be fixed32 instead, this encoding only hurts the ble link though. |
| to | fixed32 | The (immediatSee Priority description for more details.y should be fixed32 instead, this encoding only hurts the ble link though. |
| channel | uint32 | (Usually) If set, this indicates the index in the secondary_channels table that this packet was sent/received on. If unset, packet was on the primary channel. A particular node might know only a subset of channels in use on the mesh. Therefore channel_index is inherently a local concept and meaningless to send between nodes. Very briefly, while sending and receiving deep inside the device Router code, this field instead contains the 'channel hash' instead of the index. This 'trick' is only used while the payload_variant is an 'encrypted'. |

| [**oneof**](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#oneof) payload_variant.encrypted | bytes | TODO: REPLACE |
| id | fixed32 | A unique ID for this packet. Always 0 for no-ack packets or non broadcast packets (and therefore take zero bytes of space). Otherwise a unique ID for this packet, useful for flooding algorithms. ID only needs to be unique on a _per sender_ basis, and it only needs to be unique for a few minutes (long enough to last for the length of any ACK or the completion of a mesh broadcast flood). Note: Our crypto implementation uses this id as well. See [crypto](/docs/developers/firmware/encryption) for details. FIXME - really should be fixed32 instead, this encoding only hurts the ble link though. |
| rx_time | fixed32 | The time this message was received by the esp32 (secs since 1970). Note: this field is _never_ sent on the radio link itself (to save space) Times are typically not sent over the mesh, but they will be added to any Packet (chain of SubPacket) sent to the phone (so the phone can know exact time of reception) |
| rx_snr | float | Never* sent over the radio links. Set during reception to indicate the SNR of this packet. Used to collect statistics on current link quality. |
| hop_limit | uint32 | If unset treated as zero (no forwarding, send to adjacent nodes only) if 1, allow hopping through one node, etc... For our usecase real world topologies probably have a max of about 3. This field is normally placed into a few of bits in the header. |
| want_ack | bool | This packet is being sent as a reliable message, we would prefer it to arrive at the destination. We would like to receive a ack packet in response. Broadcasts messages treat this flag specially: Since acks for broadcasts would rapidly flood the channel, the normal ack behavior is suppressed. Instead, the original sender listens to see if at least one node is rebroadcasting this packet (because naive flooding algorithm). If it hears that the odds (given typical LoRa topologies) the odds are very high that every node should eventually receive the message. So FloodingRouter.cpp generates an implicit ack which is delivered to the original sender. If after some time we don't hear anyone rebroadcast our packet, we will timeout and retransmit, using the regular resend logic. Note: This flag is normally sent in a flag bit in the header when sent over the wire |
| priority | [`MeshPacket.Priority`](#meshpacketpriority) | The priority of this message for sending. See MeshPacket.Priority description for more details. |
| rx_rssi | int32 | rssi of received packet. Only sent to phone for dispay purposes. |

### User

:::note `message` description
Broadcast when a newly powered mesh node wants to find a node num it can use
Sent from the phone over bluetooth to set the user id for the owner of this node.
Also sent from nodes to each other when a new node signs on (so all clients can have this info)
The algorithm is as follows:
when a node starts up, it broadcasts their user and the normal flow is for all
other nodes to reply with their User as well (so the new node can build its nodedb)
If a node ever receives a User (not just the first broadcast) message where
the sender node number equals our node number, that indicates a collision has
occurred and the following steps should happen:
If the receiving node (that was already in the mesh)'s macaddr is LOWER than the
new User who just tried to sign in: it gets to keep its nodenum.
We send a broadcast message of OUR User (we use a broadcast so that the other node can
receive our message, considering we have the same id - it also serves to let
observers correct their nodedb) - this case is rare so it should be okay.
If any node receives a User where the macaddr is GTE than their local macaddr,
they have been vetoed and should pick a new random nodenum (filtering against
whatever it knows about the nodedb) and rebroadcast their User.
A few nodenums are reserved and will never be requested:
0xff - broadcast
0 through 3 - for future use
:::



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | string | A globally unique ID string for this user. In the case of Signal that would mean +16504442323, for the default macaddr derived id it would be !<8 hexidecimal bytes>.

| long_name | string | A full name for this user, i.e. "Kevin Hester" |
| short_name | string | A VERY short name, ideally two characters. Suitable for a tiny OLED screen |

### MeshPacket.Priority

:::note `enum` description
The priority of this message for sending.
Higher priorities are sent first (when managing the transmit queue).
This field is never sent over the air, it is only used internally inside of a local device node.
API clients (either on the local node or connected directly to the node)
can set this parameter if necessary.
(values must be <= 127 to keep protobuf field to one byte in size.
Detailed background on this field:
I noticed a funny side effect of lora being so slow: Usually when making
a protocol there isn’t much need to use message priority to change the order
of transmission (because interfaces are fairly fast).
But for lora where packets can take a few seconds each, it is very important
to make sure that critical packets are sent ASAP.
In the case of meshtastic that means we want to send protocol acks as soon as possible
(to prevent unneeded retransmissions), we want routing messages to be sent next,
then messages marked as reliable and finally ‘background’ packets like periodic position updates.
So I bit the bullet and implemented a new (internal - not sent over the air)
field in MeshPacket called ‘priority’.
And the transmission queue in the router object is now a priority queue.

### PortNum

:::note `enum` description
For any new 'apps' that run on the device or via sister apps on phones/PCs they should pick and use a
unique 'portnum' for their application.
If you are making a new app using meshtastic, please send in a pull request to add your 'portnum' to this
master table.
PortNums should be assigned in the following range:
0-63   Core Meshtastic use, do not use for third party apps
64-127 Registered 3rd party apps, send in a pull request that adds a new entry to portnums.proto to  register your application
256-511 Use one of these portnums for your private applications that you don't want to register publically
All other values are reserved.
