The Network config options are: WiFi Enabled, WiFi Mode, WiFi SSID, WiFi PSK, and NTP Server. Network config uses an admin message sending a `Config.Network` protobuf.

:::info
Enabling WiFi will disable bluetooth. Only one connection method will work at a time.
:::

ESP32 devices have the ability to connect to WiFi as a client and also are able to create a software based access point (SoftAP). WiFi can be configured in either mode.

You can [force the device to boot into SoftAP mode](#software-access-point) by rebooting the device with the program switch depressed. If forced into AP mode, it will revert to previous settings after a reboot. The device can be either a WiFi client or a software access point. It **cannot** operate as both at the same time.


## Network Config Values

### NTP Server

The NTP server used if IP networking is available.

Set to `0.pool.ntp.org` by default. (Max Length: 33)

### WiFi Enabled

Enables or Disables WiFi.

Set to `false` (Disabled) by default.

### WiFi SSID

In [SoftAP](#software-access-point) mode, this is the SSID broadcast to access your device's WiFi. 

In [Client](#wifi-client) mode, this is your WiFi Networks SSID.

Empty `""` by default. (Case Sensitive, Max Length: 33)

### WiFi PSK

In [SoftAP](#software-access-point) mode, this is the password to access your device's WiFi.

In [Client](#wifi-client) mode, this is your WiFi Networks password.

Empty `""` by default. (Case Sensitive, Max Length: 64)

### WiFi Mode

Used to set either [SoftAP](#software-access-point) or [Client](#wifi-client) WiFi modes.

Set to `CLIENT` by default.

#### Acceptable values

|   Value   |     Description              |
| :-------: | :--------------------------: |
|  `CLIENT`   | Client |
| `ACCESS_POINT` | (SoftAP) [Software Access Point](#software-access-point) |
| `ACCESS_POINT_HIDDEN` | (SoftAP) Software Access Point (Hidden) |

:::tip
The first time your device restarts after enabling the WiFi access point, it will take an additional 20-30 seconds to boot. This is to generate self-signed SSL keys. The keys will be saved for future reuse.

## Examples

### Software Access Point

With the SoftAP enabled, a DNS server will run on the device. The DNS server will respond to all DNS requests with the IP address of your device. This will simplify device discovery because you will not have to remember the device's IP â€“ any unencrypted HTTP request will direct you to the right location.

If you set your SoftAP up using a client like the CLI and have a screen attached to your device, the final page will display something similar to the following:

```
WiFi: Software AP
IP: 192.168.42.1    (0/4)
SSID: myNetwork / PWD: myPassword (alternating)
http://meshtastic.local
      * * * * *
```

You should then be able to connect to the node using either the displayed IP address or the HTTP link.

#### Force SoftAP

You can also enable the SoftAP by following these directions:

- Hold down the user button
- Press and release the reset button
- Count to two
- Let go of the user button

This will reboot the device with the SSID set to `meshtasticAdmin` and the password set to `12345678`. Using the Force SoftAP method, once you reboot, the SoftAP will be turned off.

If you have a screen attached to your device, the final page will display something similar to the following:

```
WiFi: Software AP (Admin)
IP: 192.168.42.1    (0/4)
SSID: meshtasticAdmin / PWD: 12345678 (alternating)
http://meshtastic.local
      * * * * *
```

You should then be able to connect to the node using either the displayed IP address or the HTTP link.

### WiFi Client

With `network.wifi_ssid` & `network.wifi_psk` populated, the device will know to connect to your network. Make sure you are in range of your WiFi. If you have a single Meshtastic device on your local network it's easy to connect to your device with DNS `http://meshtastic.local`. If you have multiple Meshtastic devices you will need to connect using their respective IP addresses.

If you have a screen attached to your device, the final page will display something similar to the following:

```
WiFi: Software AP (Admin)
IP: 192.168.42.1    (0/4)
SSID: myNetwork
http://meshtastic.local
      * * * * *
```

You should then be able to connect to the node using either the displayed IP address or the HTTP link.

### Disable WiFi

To disable WiFi completely, set `network.wifi_enabled` to `false`.
