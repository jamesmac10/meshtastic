hoverText: A range of frequencies used for LoRa
---

A range of frequencies used for LoRa, dependent on region. Meshtastic further divides these bands into channels. Sometimes identified by the lower and upper bounds of the range (e.g. 902-928MHz), sometimes identified by a center frequency within the range (e.g. 915MHz), and sometimes only by the region they apply to (e.g. US).
