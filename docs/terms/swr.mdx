Standing Wave Ratio, a measure of the efficiency of the radio frequency (RF) power transmission from a transmitter through a transmission line to an antenna in Meshtastic devices. It indicates the ratio of the amplitude of a standing wave at maximum to the amplitude at minimum, with an ideal SWR close to 1:1, signifying that most of the power is transmitted to the antenna with minimal reflections.
