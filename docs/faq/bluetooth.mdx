## Overview

### How do I pair my phone to the device if my device doesn't have a screen?

Use [Wifi](/docs/settings/wifi) or Bluetooth with screenless pairing: before you initiate pairing, double click on the device button. The LED will blink 3 times in confirmation and the PIN will be set temporarily to `123456`.

### Can I have Bluetooth enabled and use WiFi radio?

No. Only one method will work at a time.

### How do I disable WiFi so Bluetooth will work?

Ensure the wifi_ssid and wifi_password values are blank.
