### What is Meshtastic?

Meshtastic is the most awesome long range, low power communications service on the planet earth! That's not even an exaggeration!

### How can I contribute to Meshtastic?

Everyone contributes in a different way. Join the [Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.gg/ktMAKGBnBs) and introduce yourself. We're all very friendly. If you'd like to pitch in some code, check out the [Developers](/docs/developers) menu on the left.
