## Overview

### How do I share my Meshtastic Channel with other people?

Your Meshtastic client (Android, Web, or Python) will provide you a URL or QR code. You can email, text or print this URL or QR code and share it with people you want to join your Meshtastic Channel. Note: This feature is not yet available on the iOS app.
