This is the LoRa frequency within the frequency band your device is configured to use.

### How do I share my Meshtastic Channel with other people?

Your Meshtastic client (Android, iOS, Web or Python) will provide you a URL or QR code. You can email, text or print this URL or QR code and share it with people you want to join your Meshtastic Channel.

### What is a Primary Channel?

This is the first channel that's created for you when you initially setup your Meshtastic Channel.

### What is a Secondary Channel?

As this is a new feature, secondary channels work on the device and the Python Script. Support for secondary channels by other clients is pending. [See further details here](/docs/software/device/device-channels#how-to-use-secondary-channels).
